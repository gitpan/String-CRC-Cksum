String/CRC/Cksum version 0.91
=============================

The String::CRC::Cksum module calculates a 32 bit CRC.  It generates the
same CRC value as the POSIX cksum program.  If called in a list context,
returns the length of the data object as well, which is useful for fully
emulating the cksum program.

Despite its name, this module is able to compute the checksum of files
as well as of strings.

Beware: consider proper use of binmode() if you are on a non-UNIX platform
or processing files derived from other platforms.

The algorithm can be accessed OO style, allowing progressive supply
of data, or with a convenience function call which wraps up all the work.

The algorithm works properly on 64 bit platforms from version 0.90.
