String/CRC/Cksum version 0.01
=============================

The String::CRC::Cksum module calculates a 32 bit CRC.  It generates the
same CRC value as the POSIX cksum program.  If called in a list context,
returns the length of the data object as well, which is useful for fully
emulating the cksum program.

Despite its name, this module is able to compute the checksum of files
as well as of strings.

Beware: consider proper use of binmode() if you are on a non-UNIX platform
or processing files derived from other platforms.

There is plenty of scope for a Cksum object which can be fed data repeat-
edly and then yields the sum when asked.  However, that will have to wait
for some other 60 seconds... Stay tooned for version 0.10.
