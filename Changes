        - now requires Perl 5.6.1 at least...
        - converted to an OO style, and used it to provide
          the original functional call for your convenience
        - bucket-loads of new POD. I think it's complete;
          an easy assertion to make for such a simple module.
        - plugged in tests for the OO style, and attempted
          to distance the tests from platform issues
        - created the tarball with appropriate paths!
